### [EECS 460 Weekly Discussions](460discussion)

**Intro to control systems**

As a GSI for EECS 460, I worked with Dr. Ozay to introduce roughly 80 students to control systems. I used these slides to begin each week's discussion sessions.


*2017-01-25*

### [EECS 498 Substitute Lecture 2](498lecture2)

**Load-Tap-Changing (LTC) Transformer Dynamics**

I filled in for Dr. Hiskens again on January 25, 2017. This time the presentation focused on understanding the dynamics of LTC transformers, with an aim to reduce unnecessary strain on them due to renewable generation fluctuations.


*2017-01-13*

### [EECS 498 Substitute Lecture 1](498lecture)

**Integration of renewable energy**

I filled in for Dr. Hiskens on January 13, 2017. This presentation introduces AC power flow and the DC approximation, along with a few line rating methods. Next, I show how to identify small wind forecast deviations that bring a line flow or temperature to an unacceptable level.


*2016-03-24*

### [Research Group Presentation](2016-03-24-group-presentation)

**Research tools and project organization**

What does Power and Energy research output look like? I don't spend time in a lab, so all my work lives in files on my computer. In this talk I describe how I organize my folders and files. I then introduce four free, stable, cross-platform tools I use all the time. My investment in each has paid off handsomely over the last couple years. If your work is a mixture of scientific computing and LaTeX editing, I recommend trying them all!


*2015-04-14*

### [Research Group Presentation](2015-04-14-group-presentation)

**Enhancement to instantaneous instanton analysis: line current formulation**
