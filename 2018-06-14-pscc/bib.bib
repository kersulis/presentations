	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology and set of validation criteria for the systematic creation of synthetic power system test cases. The synthesized grids do not correspond to any real grid and are thus free from confidentiality requirements. The cases are built to match statistical characteristics found in actual power grids. First, substations are geographically placed on a selected territory, synthesized from public information about the underlying population and generation plants. A clustering technique is employed, which ensures the synthetic substations meet realistic proportions of load and generation, among other constraints. Next, a network of transmission lines is added. This paper describes several structural statistics to be used in characterizing real power system networks, including connectivity, Delaunay triangulation overlap, dc power flow analysis, and line intersection rate. The paper presents a methodology to generate synthetic line topologies with realistic parameters which satisfy these criteria. Then, the test cases can be augmented with additional complexities to build large, realistic cases. The methodology is illustrated in building a 2000-bus public test case that meets the criteria specified.},

	abstract = {Potential vulnerabilities in a power grid can be exposed by identifying those transmission lines on which attacks (in the form of interference with their transmission capabilities) causes maximum disruption to the grid. In this study, we model the grid by (nonlinear) AC power flow equations, and assume that attacks take the form of increased impedance along transmission lines. We quantify disruption in several different ways, including (a) overall deviation of the voltages at the buses from 1.0 per unit (p.u.), and (b) the minimal amount of load that must be shed in order to restore the grid to stable operation. We describe optimization formulations of the problem of finding the most disruptive attack, which are either nonlinear programing problems or nonlinear bilevel optimization problems, and describe customized algorithms for solving these problems. Experimental results on the IEEE 118-Bus system and a Polish 2383-Bus system are presented.},

In order to tackle the problem of likely widespread catastrophic failures of electric power grids, an autonomously reconfigurable power system will have to rely on wide-area communication systems, networked sensors, and restorative strategies for monitoring and control. Standard practice is to use simulation of a small number of certain historical test systems to test the efficacy of any proposed design. We believe this practice has shortcomings when examining new communication system ideas. In this paper we develop the means for producing power grids with scalable size and randomly generated topologies. These ensembles of networks can then be used as a statistical tool to study the scale of communication needs and the performance of the combined electric power control and communication networks. The topological and system features of the randomly generated power grids are compared with those of standard power system test models as a "sanity check" on the method.},

However, there are multiple ways to represent a given network as a graph. Electric power transmission and distribution networks have a topological structure that is straightforward to represent and analyze as a graph. However, simple graph models neglect the comprehensive connections between components that result from Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. This paper describes the structure of the three North American electric power interconnections, from the perspective of both topological and electrical connectivity. We compare the simple topology of these networks with that of random, preferential-attachment, and small-world networks of equivalent sizes and find that power grids differ substantially from these abstract models in degree distribution, clustering, diameter and assortativity, and thus conclude that these topological forms may be misleading as models of power systems. To study the electrical connectivity of power systems, we propose a new method for representing electrical structure using electrical distances rather than geographic connections. Comparisons of these two representations of the North American power networks reveal notable differences between the electrical and topological structures of electric power networks.},

Data visualization techniques offer several paths toward realizing such an ideal. This paper proposes various ways, in which electrical distance might be defined for empiric power systems, and records how well each candidate distance measure may be embedded in two dimensions. The resulting 2-D projections form the basis for new visualizations of empiric power systems and offer novel and useful insights into their electrical connectivity and structure.},

For vigorously promoting construction of the smart grid, it is of great significance to have a thorough understanding of the complex structural characteristics of the power grid. The structural characteristics of several actual large-scale power grids of China are studied in this paper based on the complex network theory. Firstly, the topology-based network model of power grid is recalled for analyzing the statistical characteristic parameters. The result demonstrated that although some statistical characteristic parameters could reflect the topological characteristics of power grid from different ways, they have certain limitation in representing the electrical characteristics of power grid. Subsequently, the network model based on the electrical distance is established considering the limitation of topology-based model, which reflects that current and voltage distribution in the power grid are subject to Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Law. Comparing with the topology-based model, the electrical distance-based model performs better in reflecting the natural electrical characteristic structure of power grid, especially intuitive and effective in analyzing clustering characteristics and agglomeration characteristics of power grid. These two models could complement each other.},

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

These results indicate that network structure can dramatically affect the relative effectiveness of risk identification and mitigation methods. With this in mind this paper provides a comparative analysis of the topological and electrical structure of the IEEE 300 bus and the Eastern United States power grids. Specifically we compare the topology of these grids with that of random, preferential-attachment and small-world networks of equivalent sizes and find that power grids differ substantially from these abstract models in degree distribution, clustering, diameter and assortativity, and thus conclude that these abstract models do not provide substantial utility for modeling power grids. To better represent the topological properties of power grids we introduce a new , the minimum distance graph, that produces networks with properties that more nearly match those of known power grids. While these topological comparisons are useful, they do not account for the physical laws that govern flows in electricity networks. To elucidate the electrical structure of power grids, we propose a new method for representing electrical structure as a weighted graph. This analogous representation is based on electrical distance rather than topological connections. A comparison of these two representations of the test power grids reveals dramatic differences between the electrical and topological structure of electrical power systems.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

One way to find a global optimum is to partition the problem using a spatial branch-and-bound method. Tightening upper and lower variable bounds can improve solution times in spatial branching by potentially reducing the number of partitions needed. We propose special-purpose closed-form bound tightening methods to tighten limits on nodal powers, line flows, phase angle differences, and voltage magnitudes.

Regardless of the application under consideration, all of these works rely on power system test cases for evaluation and validation. However, many of the well established power system test cases were developed as far back as the 1960s with the aim of testing AC power flow algorithms. It is unclear if these power flow test cases are suitable for power system optimization studies. This report surveys all of the publicly available AC transmission system test cases, to the best of our knowledge, and assess their suitability for optimization tasks. It finds that many of the traditional test cases are missing key network operation constraints, such as line thermal limits and generator capability curves. To incorporate these missing constraints, data driven models are developed from a variety of publicly available data sources. The resulting extended test cases form a compressive archive, NESTA, for the evaluation and validation of power system optimization algorithms.},

This paper provides advances in modeling and computation required for solving the OPF problem for large-scale, general power system models. Specifically, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the OPF problem is presented that incorporates multiple generators at the same bus and parallel lines. Recent research in matrix completion techniques that decompose a single large matrix constrained to be positive semidefinite into many smaller matrices has made solution of OPF problems using semidefinite programming computationally tractable for large system models. We provide three advances to existing decomposition techniques: a matrix combination algorithm that further decreases solver time, a modification to an existing decomposition technique that extends its applicability to general power system networks, and a method for obtaining the optimal voltage profile from the solution to a decomposed semidefinite program.},

Spectral clustering uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix associated to the network, it is computationally very efficient, and it works for any choice of weights. When using line admittances, it reveals the static internal connectivity structure of the underlying network, while using power flows highlights islands with minimal power flow disruption, and thus it naturally relates to controlled islanding. Our methodology goes beyond the standard k-means algorithm by instead representing the complete network substructure as a dendrogram. We provide a thorough theoretical justification of the use of spectral clustering in power systems, and we include the results of our methodology for several test systems of small, medium and large size, including a model of the Great Britain transmission network.},

Our method is used in two ways. One is a conversion of a sparse SDP having a large scale positive semidefinite matrix variable into an SDP having multiple but smaller positive semidefinite matrix variables to which we can effectively apply any interior-point method for SDPs employing a standard block-diagonal matrix data structure. The other way is an incorporation of our method into primal-dual interior-point methods which we can apply directly to a given SDP. In Part II of this article, we will investigate an implementation of such a primal-dual interior-point method based on positive definite matrix completion, and report some numerical results.},

In order to help the system operator in decision making under uncertainty, we aim at ranking these contingencies into four clusters according to the type of control actions needed to cover the worst uncertainty pattern of each contingency with respect to branch overload. To this end we use a fixed point algorithm that loops over two main modules: a discrete bi-level program (BLV) that computes the worst-case scenario, and a special kind of security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) which computes optimal preventive/corrective actions to cover the worst-case. We rely on a DC grid model, as the large number of binary variables, the large size of the problem, and the stringent computational requirements preclude the use of existing mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solvers. Consequently we solve the SCOPF using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver while the BLV is decomposed into a series of MILPs.

A necessary and sufficient condition is provided in this paper to guarantee the existence of no duality gap for the OPF problem. This condition is satisfied by the standard IEEE benchmark systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses as well as several randomly generated systems. Since this condition is hard to study, a sufficient zero-duality-gap condition is also derived. This sufficient condition holds for IEEE systems after small resistance (10-5 per unit) is added to every transformer that originally assumes zero resistance. We investigate this sufficient condition and justify that it holds widely in practice.

Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers.

This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a non-zero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest.

To address this issue, this paper focuses on how to determine the optimal partition for a given system and optimization problem, and quantify the improvement obtained with the optimal partition in terms of number of iterations and convergence time for solving the ac optimal power flow problem. The proposed approach is based on spectral clustering using a combination of the Hessian matrix of the optimization problem and the admittance matrix as the affinity matrix. Simulation results for the IEEE test systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning method, and the robustness of the performance of a certain partition with respect to the operating point of the system.},

	abstract = {We present a depth-first search algorithm for generating all maximal cliques of an undirected graph, in which pruning methods are employed as in the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.},

	abstract = {Convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the semi-definite programming (SDP) and second-order cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.},

	abstract = {The question of which partial Hermitian matrices (some entries specified, some free) may be completed to positive definite matrices is addressed. It is shown that if the diagonal entries are specified and principal minors, composed of specified entries, are positive, then, if the undirected graph of the specified entries is chordal, a positive definite completion necessarily exists. Furthermore, if this graph is not chordal, then examples exist without positive definite completions. In case a positive definite completion exists, there is a unique matrix, in the class of all positive definite completions, whose determinant is maximal, and this matrix is the unique one whose inverse has zeros in those positions corresponding to unspecified entries in the original partial Hermitian matrix. Additional observations regarding positive definite completions are made.},

By integrating all of these results into the SDP model a new hybrid relaxation is proposed, which combines the benefits from all of these recent works. This strengthened SDP formulation is evaluated on 71 AC Optimal Power Flow test cases from the NESTA archive and is shown to have an optimality gap of less than 1\% on 63 cases. This new hybrid relaxation closes 50\% of the open cases considered, leaving only eight for future investigation.},
